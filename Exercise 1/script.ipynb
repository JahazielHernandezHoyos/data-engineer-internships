    "In this Jupyter Notebook, there are multiple cells containing code that can be executed independently. The notebook already has some cells with code that extract information for a list of cities and plot a dashboard with all the data in Plotly. A new cell has been created that imports necessary modules, defines a dictionary of cities and their country codes, and fetches weather data for those cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. The fetched data is stored in a list called `weather_data`. The purpose of this notebook is to extract and visualize weather data for a list of cities."
